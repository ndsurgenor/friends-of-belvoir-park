The main aims of the site are as follows:
- to provide an appealing online presence for the group that encourages users to find out more
- to provide general info on Friends of Belvoir Park and their activities
- to provide specific time/date information of events organised by the group
- to provide an convenient means of contacting the group

## Initial Development

Three user stories were created at the outset of this project to guide its initial design and provide goals for the finished project:
- User A: as someone who is a resident of the local area, I want to know more about *Friends of Belvoir Park* (*FBP*) so I can decide if its something I want to be a part of.
- User B: as someone who is aware of *FBP* but only at a basic level, I want to find out what specific events *FBP* run and when they're happening so I can decide what to take part in.
- User C: as someone who is passionate about green spaces and caring for the environment, I would like to join *FBP* so I can take an active role in a ‘green community’.

The intial design ideas were developed using the interactive prototyping site [Uizard.io](https://app.uizard.io/p/517cac80)

### Features to Implement

The following are ideas which can be implemented into the site at a later time (when skillset allows):
- Add a page (Gallery) to show the latest photos from the group's activities, including a linked preview to their Instagram account.
- Add an embedded calendar on the Events page to show specific dates for at least one year ahead.

## Testing

- This site has been tested for responsiveness across different screen sizes both by utilizing Google Chrome's developer tools. The following link provides a [Responsive Preview](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://ndsurgenor.github.io/friends-of-belvoir-park/) of various screen sizes.
- This site has been tested for responsiveness in 'real-world' contexts by viewing the site on widescreen desktop and laptop setups, medium-screen tablets, and smaller-screen smartphone devices.
- This site has also been tested for responsiveness on various browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Safari.
- Navigational links have been tested to ensure that they direct to the correct page and in the case of external links that they open in a new tab.
- Paragraph text and any accompanying images have been tested to ensure they reorder correctly at various screen sizes.
- The Contact page form has been tested to ensure certain that required fields are provided when the submit button is clicked.
- The Email field within the form has been tested to ensure that an email address is provided (i.e. the text includes an @ symbol) when the submit button is clicked.

### Validator Testing 

- HTML: No errors were returned when passing each HTML page through the official W3C HTML validator
  - [index.html](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fndsurgenor.github.io%2Ffriends-of-belvoir-park%2Findex.html)
  - [events.html](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fndsurgenor.github.io%2Ffriends-of-belvoir-park%2Fevents.html)
  - [contact.html](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fndsurgenor.github.io%2Ffriends-of-belvoir-park%2Fcontact.html)
  - [confirmation.html](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fndsurgenor.github.io%2Ffriends-of-belvoir-park%2Fconfirmation.html)
- CSS: No errors were found when passing style.css through the official [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fndsurgenor.github.io%2Ffriends-of-belvoir-park%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)

### Fixed Bugs

- The *Why Join Us?* section of index.html did not intially show content in the correct order when using smaller screen sizes. This was solved by reordering the content within the code then floating the contents right as well using a series of nested divs.

### Unfixed Bugs

-  In the Contact form, at least one checkbox should be required before the form is submitted; however, giving a checkbox the attribute 'required' causes the browser to require that particular box and not just any within the same group, when the submit button is clicked. Searching online suggests that this issue is resolved using a JavaScript query so this bug can be fixed once my skillset allows.

## Deployment

The live link can be found here: https://ndsurgenor.github.io/friends-of-belvoir-park 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab (top right)
  - From the options in the lefthand side menu, select Pages
  - From the Branch section drop-down menus, select 'main' and '/root' then click 'Save'
  - The page will be automatically refreshed (after a short period) to indicate the successful deployment.
